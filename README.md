# ElasticSearch

## Why ElasticSearch?
### Elasticsearch is good for:

1- full-text search

2- Geolocalosation search

3- TF-IDF sort result in comparison with our query

4- Less insertion and lots of read, and big data or complicated search

5- Scalable

6- FuzzPositive بالاآوردن بهترین نتیجه‌ها

7- Use as noSQL storage

8- Realtime result

9- if our data doesn’t change, even if we have lots of relations between our data, we can use ElasticSearch because OneTime we create our index with all it’s relations and then we can do the queries on the indexed data

10- 


### Is not good for:

1- If we have a lot of relations between our data

2-It uses a lot of resources



It’s better to have our database and use ElasticSearch as a search engine and create the index each time needed.
RDBMS is not a search solution and we have problem to joint tables and complicated search queries.
